# Math Magicians - React Project

> The "Math magicians" is a website for all fans of mathematics. It is a Single Page App (SPA) that allows users to:

* Make simple calculations.
* Read a random math-related quote. By building this application, you will learn how to use React.

This project's goal is to teach and make sure that we know how to create an App with React and use/understand the concept of Single Page Apps.[Find project specifications here](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-react-redux/blob/main/math-magicians/sneak_peek.md)
